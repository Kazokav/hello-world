# My online BSc. in Bioinformatics
I'm currently following Open Source Society University's "Path to a free self-taught education in Bioinformatics!"

https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics

As part of this, I will track my own progress using GitHub. 

I will skip some of the classes if equivalent or similar courses are already part of my studies. 
Some courses will also be taken out of order if I feel they compliment or supplement a current course I'm taking at university. 

So far i have: 
* Skipped Introduction to Biology
* Skipped Principles of Chemistry
* Finished CS 1 - Python 1
* Begun CS 1 - Python 2
